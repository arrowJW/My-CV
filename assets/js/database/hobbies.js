    "I've fell in love with computers for as long as I can remember.<br> \
    It started out with simply playing video games and wanting to create my own, as well as make my own Flash cartoons when I discovered Newgrounds in my Secondary School years.<br><br> \
    \
    It wasn't until College that I properly began developing skills in Adobe Creative Suite and, in the prime time of my manga-drawing hobby, spent a lot of time on Clip Studio Paint with my Wacom Cintiq 13HD tablet.<br><br> \
    \
    When I started University, I was given a Toshiba Satellite Pro L870-13U laptop as part of a student support program. During my studies at Southampton Solent, I was surrounded myself with Cyberpunk and Dystopian works like Neuromancer, Bladerunner, Ghost in the Shell and Nineteen-Eighty Four which piqued my interest in hacking, mass surveillance and online privacy.<br><br>\
    \
    I wasn't interested in web design or programming, having been overwhelmed by the apparent complexity of it all, until I was prompted to study it in preparation for my Postgraduate studies. Around that time, my Toshiba was wearing down with age so I sought to revive it and was introduced to installing Linux as one of several solutions. \
    \
    While I still, mainly, use Windows, I have since pursued information Linux and BSD operating systems and use MX Linux in a virtual machine for the majority of my online activities. <br><br> \
    \
    Now, while studying web design, I am interested in learning Python and ethical hacking."

    "Linux&nbsp;/&nbsp;BSD",
    "When I started delving into the world of Linux during my Postgraduate days, my first distro was Linux Mint. Even while I used it as my laptops daily driver (and Windows on my desktop for study and work), I chased up information for the best distro to use and discovered a lot there is to know about open-source software.<br><br> \
    \
    It's thanks to that I rely on a lot of FOSS apps like KeePassXC, VeraCrypt and VirtualBox. I now do most of my browsing, emails and such on a virtual machine running MX Linux, a popular Debian-based distro without systemD - a popular but controversial init software for potential security flaws.<br><br>\
    \
    Now I'm eager to learn how to use more advanced operating systems like QubesOS, Gentoo, Void Linux and OpenBSD."

    "Hacking",
    "My interest in hacking or penetration testing was influenced from the Cyberpunk works I immersed myself in like Ghost in the Shell and William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy in which their protagonists project their minds into cyberspace to break into computer systems a la Tron.<br><br> \
    \
    As I played around with Linux, my discovery of pentesting distros like Kali Linux and Parrot OS inspired to want to study hacking for real. \
    \
    Among the games I play are hacking simulators like Uplink, Hacknet and NITE Team 4 - the latter two being more grounded in real-life hacking techniques.<br><br> \

    "Anime&nbsp;/&nbsp;Manga (and drawing)",
    "Like many people in my generation, I was introduced to Anime and Manga by the likes of Pok√®mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! (which proved to me to be an expensive hobby!).<br><br> \
    \
    Ever since Secondary School, I nurtured a hobby of drawing my own manga characters and used the manga I bought for references. \
    \
    Right now, my favorite kind of anime are Slice of Life shows like K-On!, Aria, Hakumei & Mikochi and Studio Ghibli films like When Marnie Was There to simply unwind after a day of work.<br><br> \
    \
    Also, I prefer subtitles over English dubs (with few exceptions)."
