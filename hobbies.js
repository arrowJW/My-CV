    "I've fell in love with computers for as long as I can remember.<br> \
    It started out with simply playing video games and wanting to create my own, as well as make my own Flash cartoons when I discovered <a href='https://www.newgrounds.com/' target='_blank'>Newgrounds</a> in my Secondary School years.<br><br> \
    \
    It wasn't until College that I properly began developing skills in Adobe Creative Suite and, in the prime time of my manga-drawing hobby, spent a lot of time on <a href='https://www.clipstudio.net/en/' target='_blank'>Clip Studio Paint</a> with my Wacom Cintiq 13HD tablet.<br><br> \
    \
    When I started University, I was given a Toshiba Satellite Pro L870-13U laptop as part of a student support program. During my studies at Southampton Solent, I was surrounded myself with Cyberpunk and Dystopian works like <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Neuromancer' target='_blank'>Neuromancer</a>, <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Blade_Runner' target='_blank'>Blade Runner</a>, <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)' target='_blank'>Ghost in the Shell</a> and <A href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four' target='_blank'>Nineteen-Eighty Four</a> which piqued my interest in hacking, mass surveillance and online privacy.<br><br>\
    \
    I wasn't interested in web design or programming, having been overwhelmed by the apparent complexity of it all, until I was prompted to study it in preparation for my Postgraduate studies. Around that time, my Toshiba was wearing down with age so I sought to revive it and was introduced to installing Linux as one of several solutions. \
    \
    While I still, mainly, use <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows' target='_blank'>Windows</a>, I have since pursued information <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Linux' traget='_blank'>Linux</a> and <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution' target='_blank'>BSD</a> operating systems and use <a href='https://mxlinux.org/' target='_blank'>MX Linux</a> in a virtual machine for the majority of my online activities. <br><br> \
    \
    Now, while studying web design, I am interested in learning Python and ethical hacking."

    "Linux&nbsp;/&nbsp;BSD",
    "When I started delving into the world of Linux during my Postgraduate days, my first distro was <a href='https://linuxmint.com/'>Linux Mint</a>. Even while I used it as my laptops daily driver (and Windows on my desktop for study and work), I chased up information for the best distro to use and discovered a lot there is to know about <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software' target='_blank'>Free and Open-Source Software.</a><br><br> \
    \
    It's thanks to that I rely on a lot of FOSS apps like <a href='https://keepassxc.org/' target='_blank'>KeePassXC</a>, <a href='https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/' target='_blank'>VeraCrypt</a> and <a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/' target='_blank'>VirtualBox</a>. I now do most of my browsing, emails and such on a virtual machine running MX Linux, a popular <a href='https://www.debian.org/' target='_blank'>Debian-based</a> distro without <a href='https://nosystemd.org/' target='_blank'>systemd</a> - a popular but controversial init software for potential security flaws.<br><br>\
    \
    Now I'm eager to learn how to use more advanced operating systems like <a href='https://www.qubes-os.org/' target='_blank'>QubesOS</a> and <a href='https://www.openbsd.org/' target='_blank'>OpenBSD</a>."

    "My interest in hacking or penetration testing was influenced from the <a href='https://wikiless.org/wiki/Cyberpunk' target='_blank'>Cyberpunk</a> works I immersed myself in like Ghost in the Shell and William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy in which their protagonists project their minds into cyberspace to break into computer systems a la Tron.<br><br> \
    \
    As I played around with Linux, my discovery of pentesting distros like <a href='https://www.kali.org/' target='_blank'>Kali Linux</a> and <a href='https://www.parrotsec.org/' target='_blank'>Parrot OS</a> inspired to want to study hacking for real. \
